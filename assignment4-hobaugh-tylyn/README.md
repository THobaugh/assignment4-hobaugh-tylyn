# Assignment 4
Created by Tylyn Hobaugh for the 2020 Fall Web Design Principles (MMC5277) class. I, Tylyn Hobaugh, have read the point deduction list and understand that I will lose points for missing items.

### Image
If you are going to have an image inside of the `<top-section>` your HTML should look like this:
``` html
<div class="band">
<img class="band" src="image/band.jpg" alt="Band Image" title="Band Image" />
</div>
}
```

### Troubleshooting
If your webpage is not scrolling, make sure inside of the `<body>` your CSS should look like this:
``` css
body {
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);
  background-size: cover;
  height: 100%;
  overflow: auto;
}
```
